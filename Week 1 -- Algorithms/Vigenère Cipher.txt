##### Cipher Notes #####
````````````````````````
Needs to have a key
Key must be known when encoding
Key can be known or unknown when decoding
Key has to be in range: (0 - 25)
Needs to have a plaintext
Plaintext is what gets encoded
Needs to have a ciphertext
Ciphertext is what is getting decoded

##### Cipher Encoding #####
```````````````````````````
You are given plaintext of ________. (Walk in the woods)
Write down the plaintext. (Walk in the woods)
Determine how many characters long the plaintext is. (14)
You are given a key of ____________. (trees)
Write down the key. (trees)
Keep writing the key until it matches the # of characters 
 from the plaintext that we determined earlier but,
  do so without any spaces between the words.
   Walkinthewoods
   treestreestree
Determine how many letters apart the first letter of the
 plaintext and the key are numerically.
  W = 22, T = 19
Take modulus of first letter # place from the plaintext and
 the first letter # place of the key.
  22 % 19 = 3
Figure out which letterr is in the # place from the modulus
 above.
  D = 3
Write down the letter in the # place from the modulus above,
 this is the first letter of your ciphertext.
Repeat steps 50 through 59 moving onto the next letter of
 the plaintext each time.

 ciphertext and the key are numerically.
  D = 3, T = 19
Take modulus of first letter # place from the plaintext and
 the first letter # place of the key.
  3 % 19 = 3
Figure out which letter is in the # place from the modulus
 above.
  D = 3
Write down the letter in the # place from the modulus above,
 this is the first letter of your plaintext.
Repeat steps 77 through 86 moving onto the next letter of
 the ciphertext each time.
